##Final Evaluation Module 2

For this exercise we will use the Sakila database that we have been using during the SQL review. It is an example database that simulates a movie rental store. It contains tables such as film, actor, customer, rental, category, among others. These tables contain information about movies, actors, customers, rentals, and more, and are used to perform queries and data analysis in the context of a movie rental store.
