**Final Evaluation Module 2 SQL**

For this exercise we will use the Sakila database that we have been using during the SQL review. 
It is an example database that simulates a movie rental store. It contains tables such as film, actor, customer, rental, category, among others. These tables contain information about movies, actors, customers, rentals, and more, and are used to perform queries and data analysis in the context of a movie rental store.






**Objective of the evaluation**

The objective of this evaluation is to apply the SQL knowledge acquired during the course to perform queries and analysis in the Sakila database. 

The way I approach these exercises is not only by applying all the knowledge learned in class, but also by trying to do it as simply and efficiently as possible.
